### Comments
Your proposal has a minor flaw in the algorithm space.

**Dataset**
The dataset to too big for an O(n^3) algorithm. Figure out a way to obtain a subset while still having a reasonable graph.

**Algorithm**
Dijkstra's is primarily used on a weighted graph. Your graph has no weights. Either assign weights or change your algorithm. Simply using a BFS is sufficient to obtain the shortest path in an un-weighted graph.
