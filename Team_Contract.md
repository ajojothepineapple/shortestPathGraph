# Team Contract

## Communication:

**1. Team Meetings**
Currently we are planning to allocate about 30 minutes each Sunday at 2pm in order to meet up to talk about each others' progress and assign new tasks. The time allocated might be revised if the need for this will arrise. We will either meet in Zoom or in person in ECEB depending on how fesable it will be during the weekend. We will alternate in taking notes (Using Google Docs) and the person taking notes will be responsible for the progress log at that week as well.

**2. Assistance**
In order to keep contact with each other we have created a Discord group. The expectation currently is for people to respond within 12 hours.

**3. Respect**
We will allocate time for everyone to speak during our meeting and make sure that all of the proposed ideas are written down by the person, who is assigned to take notes on that particular day.

## Collaboration:

**Work Distribution**
We will aim to assign equal amounts of work to each of the team members on the team meetings. During the check-in on each others' progress in the team meeting if we find that the work assigned to any particular member is too much or if the team member is busy, we will re-distribute the work by assigning more people to a particular task.

**Time Commitment**
We are currently expecting each team member to contribute about 5-10 hours of work per week, but this might change as we go further with the project. Addressing new conflicts will either be handled via voting or contacting our team mentor.

**Conflict Resolution**
Disagreements between members will either be handeled by voting or addressed with the help of the team mentor. If members are habitually late or are not accomplishing their tasks without informing other tem members for their reasons we are going to try to bring the issue up on the team meeting and if it escalates then through a team mentor. Other situations of a simular nature will be handled similarly.
