# Progress Log

**4/3/2022:**
This week we adjusted the project proposal to fit the requirements for the project. Our dataset was incompatible with the Djikstra’s algorithm, so we had to find a weighted dataset which was more suited to it. We decided to go with a road network of the City of Oldenburg, Germany. We also decided not to use a force-directed graph because it didn’t add any meaningful information to the road network. Instead, we have decided to just make a graphical representation of the data from the coordinates provided in the dataset. The plan for next week is to split up into groups and develop some pseudo code for our dataset parsing and future algorithms.

**4/10/2022**
We split into the two groups parsing the txt/DFS and Djikstra's algorithm. For parsing and DFS we have pseudocode for DFS and are debugging our parser code (Artem and Ajosh made parser code) . We have made pseudo code for Djikstra's (Micheal and John) and found we could make an adjacency matrix while parsing. We are thinking about changing how we make our map since creating the map doesn’t use any algorithm since the x and y coordinates are given. We plan to apply the DFS on the stored data and adjust parser code. We did not meet our proposal code since we have not finished the parser code but we are still on track. 

**4/17/2022**
This week one of our groups (John and Michael) have finished up the prototype for the Djikstra's algorithm. The other group (Artem and Ajosh) have finished up the Parser and the DFS algorithm with some tests to check whether the algorithms actually work. We have changed up the DFS to traversal rather than search, since Djikstra's algorithm is already searching for the shortest path from a certain Node to a certain Node, while our has one connected component and because we switched to the Edge List representation for the graph, looking up a Node can just be done by looking up its position in the vector it is stored. We have finished the tasks that were laid out this week, according to the project proposal. The aim for this week is to finish up the Djikstra's algorithm fully with the implemented adjency matrix and figure out the implementation for the grahing algorithm, pushing its implementation slightly further back in schedule, according to the proposal timeline.

**4/24/2022**
This week Artem and Ajosh completed what seems to be a nearly complete algorithm for graphically outputting our nodes and edges to a PNG. It visually matches the actual map of the City of Oldenburg, but there are a few bugs to work out such as edges that almost reach their destination node but not quite. Additionally, Michael and John finished the first compiling draft of our Dijkstra's Algorithm. The only thing we need to do for Dijkstra's is to initialize our adjacency matrix, write tests cases, and debug as necessary. For next week we should implement our adjacency matrix and write test cases for the Dijkstra's algorithm. Additionally, we should write test cases for the graphing algorithm and debug as necessary.

**5/1/2022**
This week Artem and Ajosh have ironned out the bugs in the graphing algorithm and completed the algorithm that maps the path onto the map when given the nodes of the path, which is going to be used when mapping the Dijkstra's Algorithm on the said map. John and Michael are close to completing the shortest path algorithm, but there are some small bugs that need to be fixed. We are a bit behind the proposal timeline and the aims for the given week, but nothing critical. Michael and John are going to finish up the Dijkstra's Algorithm by the middle of the next week, Ajosh will work on switching the algorithms to work from the command line arguments and Artem will work on the other deliverable, such as report, README and presentation. We are planning to meet and record our presentation in the middle of next week.
