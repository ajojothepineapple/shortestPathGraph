# Progress Log

**4/3/2022:**
This week we adjusted the project proposal to fit the requirements for the project. Our dataset was incompatible with the Djikstra’s algorithm, so we had to find a weighted dataset which was more suited to it. We decided to go with a road network of the City of Oldenburg, Germany. We also decided not to use a force-directed graph because it didn’t add any meaningful information to the road network. Instead, we have decided to just make a graphical representation of the data from the coordinates provided in the dataset. The plan for next week is to split up into groups and develop some pseudo code for our dataset parsing and future algorithms.

**4/10/2022**
We split into the two groups parsing the txt/DFS and Djikstra's algorithm. For parsing and BFS we have pseudocode for DFS and are debugging our parser code (Artem and Ajosh made parser code) . We have made pseudo code for Djikstra's (Micheal and John) and found we could make an adjacency matrix while parsing. We are thinking about changing how we make our map since creating the map doesn’t use any algorithm since the x and y coordinates are given. We plan to apply the DFS on the stored data and adjust parser code. We did not meet our proposal code since we have not finished the parser code but we are still on track.
