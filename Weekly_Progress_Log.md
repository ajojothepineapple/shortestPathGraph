# Progress Log

**4/3/2022:**
This week we adjusted the project proposal to fit the requirements for the project. Our dataset was incompatible with the Djikstra’s algorithm, so we had to find a weighted dataset which was more suited to it. We decided to go with a road network of the City of Oldenburg, Germany. We also decided not to use a force-directed graph because it didn’t add any meaningful information to the road network. Instead, we have decided to just make a graphical representation of the data from the coordinates provided in the dataset. The plan for next week is to split up into groups and develop some pseudo code for our dataset parsing and future algorithms.
